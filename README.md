# About One Nexus

One Nexus was created by [Edmund Reed](http://edmundreed.co.uk/), a UK based web/UX designer and front-end developer.

Put simply, One Nexus is a front end solution to building modern and responsive websites fast and efficiently. It is a combination of tools, ideas, principles and existing resources to provide a sensible, intuitive and easy to customize solution to your front end needs. There are many reasons why it was created, but the main reason for its existance is to offer any one who uses it a useful headstart for their next project.

## Getting Started

### Option 1 - Classic Download

To set One Nexus up with your new project the good old fashioned way, [download the latest copy](https://github.com/esr360/One-Nexus/archive/master.zip), extract the files and open with your favourite text editor.

### Option 2 - Bower Installation

```html
bower install one-nexus
```

If you really don't want to use a CSS pre-processor you can still work directly on the regular, compiled CSS.

One Nexus is built in [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets), so to truly make the most from it you will need a way of pre-processing your CSS. Most front end developers are now familiar with pre-processing, so if you are, great! If you're not, check out these resources to learn how to get set up using a pre-processor.

 * [What is pre-processing, and why should I use it?](http://www.onenexusproject.com/tutorials/what-is-pre-processing-and-why-should-i-use-it/)
 * [How do I set up One Nexus with a pre-procesor?](http://www.onenexusproject.com/tutorials/how-do-i-set-up-one-nexus-with-a-pre-processor/)


## Project Architecture

Once you have your copy of One Nexus set up for your new project, open the entire directory with your favourite text editor (we use [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)), and open the **app.scss** file located here:


```html
assets > styles > scss > app.scss
```


```css
/******************************************************************

Site Name: Website name here
Author: Your name/company here

******************************************************************/

/******************************************************************

******************************************************************/

@import "skeleton/normalize";
@import "skeleton/variables";
@import "skeleton/base";
@import "skeleton/grid";
@import "skeleton/helpers";
@import "skeleton/print";

/******************************************************************

@import "elements/lists";
@import "elements/modals";
@import "elements/progress-bars";
@import "elements/tabs";
@import "elements/tables";
@import "elements/tooltips";

/******************************************************************

@import "modules/breadcrumb";
@import "modules/footer";
@import "modules/header";
@import "modules/logo";
@import "modules/main-nav";
@import "modules/off-canvas-nav";
@import "modules/scroll-top";
```

We like to think of websites as being made up of **pages**, which are made up of **modules**, which are made up of **elements**. Each [element](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/elements/) and [module](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/modules/) has its own SASS partial, with the option to easily create a partial for individual pages as well.

## Building Your Website

### Basic HTML Structure

One Nexus comes with a sample **index.html** file which contains a basic example page with a structure similar to the following:


```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en" class="no-js">

	<head>
	    <meta charset="utf-8">
	    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge,chrome=1">

</html>
```

## Features

### Responsive Grid system

One of the most important features of One Nexus is the responsive grid system. It allows you to build highly reliable websites which work great on all devices and resolutions thanks to the use of percentages instead of fixed widths.

Unlike most grid systems out there, our columns use inline-block display instead of floating them, making them more flexible.

---

#### Grid Structure

```html
assets > styles > scss > skeleton > _variables.scss
```

This is where you set the main structural variables for your project's framework. Change these to any value you desire, or leave them as they are - the default values work well in most cases.

```css
/******************************************************************
Skeleton
******************************************************************/

$main-width       :   1200px;
$max-width        :   90%;

$columns          :   12;
$gutter           :   2.5%;

/*****************************************************************/
```

##### Main Width ($main-width)

This is where you set the width for the main site container - pretty self-explanatory. This variable can any numeric value; pixels, percentage, em or rem.

##### Max Width ($max-width)

This variable sets the maximum allowed width for the main site container, and will override the previous **$main-width** variable where applicable. It is recommended you use a high percentage for this value, as this is what stops the page from being too wide on smaller resolutions.

##### Columns ($columns)

This is where you can set the number of columns for your grid. Twelve is popularly accepted as the number to use as it is divisible by 2, 3, 4 and 6, allowing for a more flexible system. Feel free to override this if you know what you're doing, our math will calculate your grid no matter the value you enter here.

##### Gutter ($gutter)

The gutter is the gap between each column. As our grid system uses percentage widths, the value you enter here must be a percentage and will not work if you enter a px value.

---

#### Example Using Default Values

It is typical to wrap your website's content in a main **container** or wrapper class. The container class uses the width set by the **$main-width** variable.

```html
<div class="container">
	...
</div>
```

Each row of columns needs to be put in its own row class.

```html
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		...
	</div>
</div>
```

The total number of column spans should equate to the value defined by the **$columns** variable. Using our default example of 12, we have created a row consiting of an **8 column span** and a **4 column span**, which adds up to our total of 12 columns.

```html
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="span-8">
			...
		</div>
		<div class="span-4">
			...
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
```

---

#### Breakpoints

Breakpoints are what allow you to style your CSS for a specific selection of browser widths. They work by using **CSS media queries**. You can set as many of these as you like and set them to whatever values you think are suitable for your project.

By default each column expands to 100% width when the resolution is less than the value defined by $breakpoint-3.

```css
/******************************************************************
Breakpoints
******************************************************************/

$breakpoint-0     :   0px;
$breakpoint-1     :   460px;
$breakpoint-2     :   720px;
$breakpoint-3     :   940px;
$breakpoint-4     :   1200px;
$breakpoint-5     :   1400px;

$bp-values        :   $breakpoint-0, $breakpoint-1, $breakpoint-2, $breakpoint-3, $breakpoint-4, $breakpoint-5;

$bp-names         :   bp0, bp1, bp2, bp3, bp4, bp5;

/*****************************************************************/
```

The **$bp-values** and **$bp-names** variables are used to generate classes for the [custom column collapsing](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/features/responsive-grid-system/#custom-column-collapsing) feature. To read about how to customize and create your own mobile-first responsive modules using these breakpoint values, header over to the One Nexus [modules](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/modules) page.

#### Advanced Usage

Our grid system has much more to offer than the basic structure we have show you. Learn what else you can achieve with One Nexus to further enhance your project's framework.

##### Aligning Columns

Thanks to the use of **display: inline-block;** you are easily able to align your columns both horizontally and vertically.

###### Horizontal Aligning

The below example shows how to horizontally align a row of columns that do not add up to the value defined by $columns.

```html
<div class="container">
	<div class="row text-center">
		<div class="span-3">
			...
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
```

Horizontally aligning the columns like this is simple; all that is required is the addition of the **text-align** property to the **.row** class, choosing either left, right or center as desired. Thanks to our [Helper Classes](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/skeleton/helpers/), you can also simply add the class **text-left**, **text-right** or **text-center** directly to the row.

###### Vertical Aligning

The example below shows how you can easily control the vertical alignment of your columns.

By default, columns are set to vertical-align: top.

```html
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="span-3 va-top">
			...
		</div>
		<div class="span-3 va-middle">
			...
		</div>
		<div class="span-3 va-bottom">
			...
		</div>
		<div class="span-3 va-middle" style="min-height: 175px;">
			...
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
```

Aligning your columns vertically is as simple as setting the **vertical-align** property on the columns you want to align. The most common values for this property are top, middle and bottom. You can also use the provied [Helper Classes](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/skeleton/helpers/) of **va-top**, **va-middle** and **va-bottom** by adding them to any column.

You can only vertically align columns relative to the tallest column in a row.


##### Block Columns

Block columns are similar to regular columns except that they have no gutter (no margin) and they are all equal height to each other.

```html
<div class="container">
	<div class="row block-columns">
		<div class="span-4">
			...
		</div>
		<div class="span-4">
			...
		</div>
		<div class="span-4">
			...
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
```

To create a row of block columns, simply add the **block-columns** class to your row which contains the target columns.

##### Custom Column Collapsing

By default the columns collapse to 100% width at **$breakpoint-3** so that they are stacked vertically. Sometimes you may have a row of colums which you need to collapse at a larger or smaller resolution than others. Setting the width to collapse your row of columns is made simple with One Nexus, as seen in the following example.

```html
<div class="container">
	<div class="row bp2">
		<div class="span-6">
			...
		</div>
		<div class="span-6">
			...
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row bp4">
		<div class="span-6">
			...
		</div>
		<div class="span-6">
			...
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
```

To manually override the default collapsing of **$breakpoint-3** you can use the following classes: **bp1**, **bp2**, **bp3**, **bp4** and **bp5** to choose which breakpoint width you would like the columns to collapse at. Simply add your desired class to the main **row** which contains your columns. For example, if you wanted your columns to collapse at the width defined by the **$breakpoint-2** variable, you would add the **bp2** class to your row.

### HTML5 Boilerplate

One Nexus is built off the popular [HTML5](http://html5boilerplate.com/) Boilerplate, making it a fast, robust and adaptable solution from the very beginning. Many native features of One Nexus are included as a result of using H5BP as a base template, including:

* [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) for CSS normalizations and common bug fixes
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) via CDN, with a local fallback
* [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) build for feature detection
* Useful CSS [Helper Classes](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/skeleton/helpers/)
* Default [print CSS](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/skeleton/print/), performance optimized


---

### jQuery & Plugins

One Nexus comes with with jQuery included out of the box. We use [Google's CDN version](https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide#jquery) by default, with the option to switch to a self hosted version instead. The scripts that come with One Nexus come in two types: complementary scripts for our Interactive Elements and Modules which each have ther own JS file, and scripts for general UI/UX enhancements which are found in global.js.

By default, jQuery is included at the bottom of index.html, linking to [Google's hosted version](https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide#jquery).

```html

	...
    
	<body>

		...

		<!-- Scripts -->

		<!-- jQuery -->
		<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
		<!--<script src="assets/scripts/jquery.1.10.0.min.js"></script>-->

	    <!-- Interactive Elements/Modules -->
	    <script src="assets/js/accordion.js"></script>
	    <script src="assets/js/carousel.js"></script>
	    <script src="assets/js/modal.js"></script>
	    <script src="assets/js/off-canvas-nav.js"></script>
	    <script src="assets/js/tabs.js"></script>
	    <script src="assets/js/tooltip.js"></script>

		<!-- General -->
		<script src="assets/scripts/global.js"></script>

	</body>
    
    ...

```

It is essential that all jQuery scripts and plugins are included after the link to jQuery itself.

By default we do not minify our JS files. When your project goes live, we recommend that you minify all of your assets.

It is recommended that you use one of the jQuery copies from the [Google Hosted Libraries](https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/), as included by default with One Nexus. However, should you decide to use your own hosted version, we have also provided the option for that too, directly underneath. Simply uncomment it out from the code, and delete the Google hosted version.

---

#### Adding Your Own Scripts

Due to the open nature of One Nexus, there is no set place for you to add your own scripts, it's completely up to you. The default structure of our scripts is based off what the script is for. For scripts which complement our [Interactive CSS Elements](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/elements/interactive/) we have created a seperate JS file for each element. For general UI/UX enhancements, plugin initialisations and scripts that affect global modules we have put them in our global.js file.

---

#### Interactive Elements & Modules

Typically, most [Interactive CSS Elements](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/elements/interactive/) require some additional jQuery code for their functionality. In these instances (which is the case for all the default interactive elements which come with One Nexus), each interactive element has its own JS file.


##### Interactive Elements

* [Accorsions](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/elements/interactive/accordions)
* [Carousels](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/elements/interactive/carousels/)
* [Modals](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/elements/interactive/modal-windows/)
* [Tabs](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/elements/interactive/tabs/)
* [Tooltips](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/elements/interactive/tooltips/)

##### Interactive Modules

* [Off-Canvas Navigation](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/modules/off-canvas-nav/)

---

#### UI/UX Enhancements

Found within our **global.js** file are a load of tasty jQuery treats to enhance your project's UI and UX. Some of the code here is required for some of the default [Modules](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/modules/)' and [Interactive Elements](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/elements/interactive/)' functionality, whereas the rest is for optional enhancements.

##### Scroll to Top/Smooth Scrolling

This nifty little feature is something we believe every website should have (which is why we've included it!). It displays a button in the bottom-right hand side of the page when the user has scrolled down more than **350px**, which scrolls the user back to the top of the page when clicked.

```javascript
$(window).bind("scroll", function() {
    if ($(this).scrollTop() > 350) {
        $(".scroll-top").addClass("active");
    } else {
        $(".scroll-top").stop().removeClass("active");
    }
});
```

The script works by adding/removing the **active** class from the button - the actual fade in/fade out animation effects are controlled by CSS in the following partial:

```html
assets > styles > scss > elements > _scroll-top.scss
```

The scroll-to-top button is included by default in the provided **index.html** file, and can be added to other pages by adding the following snippet to the bottom of your page:

```html
<a class="fa fa-angle-up scroll-top" href="#site-content"></a> 
```

In order for this feature to work properly, your **body** element must be wrapped in a container with an id of **#site-content** applied to it.

The smooth page scrolling animation is achieved with the following script, which also works for all other same-page anchors:


```javascript
$("a[href*=#]").click(function() {
    if (location.pathname.replace(/^\//,"") == this.pathname.replace(/^\//,"") 
        || location.hostname == this.hostname) {
        var target = $(this.hash);
        target = target.length ? target : $("[name=" + this.hash.slice(1) +"]");
           if (target.length) {
             $("html,body").animate({
                 scrollTop: target.offset().top
            }, 1200);
            return false;
        }
    }
});
```
---

#### Minifying Scripts

Everyone has their own way of doing things, so we don't want to dictate how to organise your project. That's why all of our assets are un-minified by default - so you can have complete control over your project. We do not recommend serving un-minified assets (including both scripts and CSS) to your users as it can have negative impacts on performance. This is why we strongly suggest that you minify all scripts and CSS for production sites, leaving the un-minified assets for development purposes.

Whilst we strongly recommend minifying your scripts and CSS, it is by no means required if you are not comfortable doing so.

[Read our guide on minifying assets to improve your project's performance.](http://www.onenexusproject.com/tutorials/minify-your-assets-to-improve-performance/)

### Google Fonts

One Nexus comes ready to use with Google Fonts out of the box, allowing you to quickly and easily manage your website's typography. Your project is by no menas limited to using only Google Fonts, they are only included as a quick starting point, and switching them out for other web fonts or a self hosted soltion is simple.

[Visit the google fonts homepage](https://www.google.com/fonts#).

## Skeleton

### Base

This is where all the core CSS for your project is placed. It contains the main structural CSS as well as some other useful snippets. The base SCSS partial is located in the **skeleton** folder:


```javascript
assets > styles > scss > skeleton > _base.scss
```

##### The SASS/CSS

We have broken the CSS down to individual chunks so we can analyse it more easily. Below you will find everything that appears in the default **_base.scss** partial, with a breif overview about what it does and why we've included it.

```css
html, body {
	padding: 0;
	margin: 0;
}
```

We remove any default **padding** and **margin** applied by the browser.

---

```css
html {
	overflow-x: hidden;
}
```

We set the HTML element to **overflow-x: hidden** to hide any unwated horizontal scroll.

---

```css
body {
    line-height: 1.4;
    font-family: $font-1;
    color: $main-text-color;
	background-color: $background-color;
	font-size: $small-font-size;
    @media (min-width: $breakpoint-3) {
    	font-size: $base-font-size;
	}
}
```

This is where we set the main styling for the **body** element; we set the typography and our main background. We apply the **$small-font-size** variable for lowest resolutions, and then apply the main **$base-font-size** variable in a media query set at the width defined by **$breakpoint-3**.

---

```css
.container {
	width: $main-width;
	max-width: $max-width;
	margin: 0 auto;
}
```

This is our main **container** element. We set the **width** and **max-width** using our [variables](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/skeleton/variables/), and horizontally center the container in the page with margin: 0 auto.

---

```css
.row { 
    letter-spacing: -0.31em; /* Webkit: collapse white-space between units */
    *letter-spacing: normal; /* reset IE < 8 */
    *word-spacing: -0.43em; /* IE < 8: collapse white-space between units */
    text-rendering: optimizespeed; /* Webkit: fixes text-rendering: optimizeLegibility */
}

.opera-only :-o-prefocus,
.row {
    word-spacing: -0.43em;
}
```

This code may look obscure and awkward, but it is the magic that allows us to use **inline-block** in a **cross-browser** environment for our columns. By default, adding **display: inline-block** to an element causes a natural [whitespace](http://css-tricks.com/fighting-the-space-between-inline-block-elements/) to appear between each element, which can vary in width from font to font and browser to browser. Indeed, this has [caused many people many problems](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=inline-block+column), and there are plenty of go-to [hacky and impractical work arounds](http://davidwalsh.name/remove-whitespace-inline-block), none of which are really suitble for a production environment. However, the above code when combined with our grid [system](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/skeleton/grid/) produces completely usable and functional columns which use **inline-block** and have **no white-space**. And to top it all off, it works on all modern browsers!

---

```css
* {
    letter-spacing: normal;
    word-spacing: normal;
    text-rendering: auto;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

The famous [&lowast; { box-sizing: border-box }](http://www.paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/) has been included by default with One Nexus. We also apply a global reset of **letter-spacing**, **word-spacing** and **text-rendering** to make up for any effects caused by our column white-space removal.

---

```css
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, hgroup, p, ul, ol, dd, figure, pre, table, fieldset, legend, hr {
    margin: $base-margin 0;
    &:first-child {
    	margin-top: 0;
    }
    &:last-child {
        margin-bottom: 0;
    }
}
```

The above code tackles the issue of the [spacing above and below modules](http://css-tricks.com/spacing-the-bottom-of-modules/). Generally, we want the majority of our HTML elements that form the main content to be equally spaced between each other in an intuitive manner. This means no spacing at the very top of the content, and none at the bottom, but an equal space between each main element. The above code does just that, and takes advantage of the collapsing behaviour of margins.

---

```css
::selection {
	background-color: $brand-1;
	color: #fff;
	text-shadow: none;
}

::-moz-selection {
	background-color: $brand-1;
	color: #fff;
	text-shadow: none;
}
```

This is where you can set the default appearance for highlighted text on your project. Many websites often miss this simple and subtle effect, but we think it is a definite must for any project.

---

### Grid

One of the most important features of One Nexus is the responsive grid system. It allows you to build highly reliable websites which work great on all devices and resolutions thanks to the use of percentages instead of fixed widths. The grid SCSS partial is located in the **skeleton** folder:


```html
assets > styles > scss > skeleton > _grid.scss
```

##### The SASS/CSS

We have broken the CSS down to individual chunks so we can analyse it more easily. Below you will find everything that appears in the default **_grid.scss** partial, with a breif overview about what it does and why we've included it.

---

```css
[class*="span"] {
    display: inline-block;
    zoom: 1; *display: inline; /* IE < 8: fake inline-block */
    vertical-align: top;
	margin-left: $gutter;
	&:first-child {
		margin-left: 0;
	}
}
```

This is the CSS for our individual columns. We add a display of **inline-block** so that they align next to each other, and set their vertical-align to **top**. We add a gutter between our columns by adding a **margin-left** using the value defined by the [$gutter variable](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/skeleton/variables/), and then remove it from the first column (as it should sit flush with the container).

---

```css
@for $i from 1 through $columns {
	.span-#{$i} {			
		width: ( (100/$columns) * $i) - ( ( ((100 / ((100/$columns) * $i)) - 1) * $gutter ) / ( $columns / $i ) )
	}
}
```

This beautiful equation calculcates and generates the CSS for each column width. It uses the **$columns** and **$gutter** [variables](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/skeleton/variables/) to create the grid-system, and will create a grid for whatever values you set them as.

---

```css
.row {

/******************************************************************
Default Column Stacking
******************************************************************/

	@media (max-width: $breakpoint-3) {
		&:not([class*="bp"]) {
			> [class*="span"] {
				margin-left: 0;
				width: 100%;
			}
			&.block-columns {
				> [class*="span"] {
					display: inline-block;
				}
			}
		}
	}

/******************************************************************
Custom Column Stacking
******************************************************************/

	@function bp($name) {
		@return nth($bp-values, index($bp-names, $name))
	}

	@each $name in $bp-names {
		@media (max-width: bp($name)) {
			&.#{$name} {
				[class*="span"] {
					margin-left: 0;
					width: 100%;
				}
				&.block-columns {
					> [class*="span"] {
						display: inline-block;
					}
				}
			}
		}
	} 	

	...

} // End .row
```

This code allows for the [custom column collapsing](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/features/responsive-grid-system/#advanced-usage) feature, and also sets the default point at which the columns should collapse to 100% width and stack on top of each other. The equation pulls the values from the [$breakpont variables](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/skeleton/variables/) to create a class for each breakpoint. 

To learn how to use this feature on your project, visit the [Responsive Grid System](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/features/responsive-grid-system/) documentation page.

---

```css
.row {
	
	&.block-columns {
		> [class*="span"] {
			display: table-cell;
		}
	}

} /* End Row */
```
This code allows you to create [block columns](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/features/responsive-grid-system/#advanced-usage) in your project. It's amazingly simple how it works, it simply adds the **display: table-cell** property to each column in the row, which removes the gutter and makes them all equal height.

To learn how to use this feature on your project, visit the [Responsive Grid System](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/features/responsive-grid-system/) documentation page.

---

### Helpers

One of the benefits of the [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) (which One Nexus is built on) is the inclusion of a [common CSS helpers](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/v4.3.0/doc/css.md#common-helpers) stylesheet. Our helpers stylesheet is built off this and contains some of our own additional helpers to enhance your project's framework. The helpers SCSS partial is located in the **skeleton** folder:

```html
assets > styles > scss > skeleton > _helpers.scss
```

---

#### .hidden

```css
.hidden {
    display: none !important;
    visibility: hidden;
}
```

From the [H5BP documentation](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/doc/css.md):

The **hidden** class can be added to any element that you want to hide visually and from screen readers. It could be an element that will be populated and displayed later, or an element you will hide with JavaScript.

---

#### .visually-hidden

```css
.visually-hidden {
    border: 0;
    clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
    height: 1px;
    margin: -1px;
    overflow: hidden;
    padding: 0;
    position: absolute;
    width: 1px;
    &.focusable {
        &:active, &:focus {
            clip: auto;
            height: auto;
            margin: 0;
            overflow: visible;
            position: static;
            width: auto;
        }
    }
}
```

From the [H5BP documentation](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/doc/css.md):

The **visually-hidden** class can be added to any element that you want to hide visually, while still have its content accessible to screen readers.

See also:

* [CSS in Action: Invisible Content Just for Screen Reader Users](http://www.webaim.org/techniques/css/invisiblecontent/)
* [Hiding content for accessibility](http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/hiding-content-for-accessibility)
* [HTML5 Boilerplate - Issue #194](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/issues/194/)


---

#### .invisible

```css
.invisible {
    visibility: hidden;
}
```

From the [H5BP documentation](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/doc/css.md):

The **invisible** class can be added to any element that you want to hide visually and from screen readers, but without affecting the layout.

As opposed to the **hidden** class that effectively removes the element from the layout, the **invisible** class will simply make the element invisible while keeping it in the flow and not affecting the positioning of the surrounding content.

N.B. Try to stay away from, and don't use the classes specified above for [keyword stuffing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyword_stuffing) as you will harm your site's ranking!

---

#### .clearfix


```css
.clearfix, .cf {
    zoom: 1;
    &:before, &:after { 
        content: ""; 
        display: table; 
    }
    &:after { 
        clear: both; 
    }
}
```

From the [H5BP documentation](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/doc/css.md):

The **clearfix** class can be added to any element to ensure that it always fully contains its floated children.

Over the years there have been many variants of the clearfix hack, but currently, we use the [micro clearfix](http://nicolasgallagher.com/micro-clearfix-hack/).

---

#### Vertically Align Columns


```css
.va-top {
    vertical-align: top !important;
}
.va-middle {
    vertical-align: middle !important;
}
.va-bottom {
    vertical-align: bottom !important;
}
```

The **vertical align** classes allow you to easily control the vertical alignment of your columns. Simply add the class to each column in a row that you want to edit the vertical alignment of.

[Click here](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/features/responsive-grid-system/#advanced-usage) to read more about how to control the vertical alignment of your columns.

---

#### Vertically Align Anything


```css
.vam {    
    position: relative;
    top: 50%;
    transform: translateY(-50%);
}
```

From [zerosixthree](http://zerosixthree.se/vertical-align-anything-with-just-3-lines-of-css/):

With just 3 lines of CSS (excluding vendor prefixes) we can with the help of transform: translateY vertically center whatever we want, even if we don’t know its height.

The CSS property transform is usally used for rotating and scaling elements, but with its translateY function we can now vertically align elements. Usually this must be done with absolute positioning or setting line-heights, but these require you to either know the height of the element or only works on single-line text etc.

---

#### .image-replacement

```css
.image-replacement {
    text-indent: 100%;
    white-space: nowrap;
    overflow: hidden;
}
```
From [zeldman.com](http://www.zeldman.com/2012/03/01/replacing-the-9999px-hack-new-image-replacement/):

* Really long strings of text will never flow into the container because they always flow away from the container.
* Performance is dramatically improved because a 9999px box is not drawn. Noticeably so in animations on the iPad 1.


---

#### Horizontal Rules

```css
hr.line {
    color: rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
    margin: $base-margin 0;
}
hr.dotted {
    color: rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
    border-top: 1px dotted;
    margin: $base-margin 0;
}
```

One Nexus comes with an alternative horizontal rule which is less intrusive than the default one, and can be used to easily section off the content of your page.

---

#### Horizontal Aligning


```css
.text-left { 
    text-align: left !important; 
}
.text-center { 
    text-align: center !important; 
}
.text-right { 
    text-align: right !important; 
}

.left  { 
    float: left !important; 
}
.right { 
    float: right !important; 
}
```

The above classes can be used to quickly and simply control the horizontal alignment of your elements.

[Click here](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/features/responsive-grid-system/#advanced-usage) to read more about how to control the horizontal alignment of your columns.

---

#### Responsive Visibility


```css
/* Show only when resolution is at most X
================================================================ */

@function maxbp($name) {
    @return nth($bp-values, index($bp-names, $name))
}

@each $name in $bp-names {
    .max-#{$name} {
        @media (min-width: maxbp($name)) {
            display: none !important;
        }
    }
}

/* Show only when resolution is at least X
================================================================ */

@function minbp($name) {
    @return nth($bp-values, index($bp-names, $name))
}

@each $name in $bp-names {
    .min-#{$name} {
        @media (max-width: minbp($name)) {
            display: none !important;
        }
    }
}
```

The above code generates a set of classes using using the [breakpoint variables](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/features/responsive-grid-system/#breakpoints). These classes let you hide or show certain elements depending on the resolution. By default the above function generates two sets of six classes using the **$bp-names variables**.

### Example CSS Output

```css
/* Show only when resolution is at most X
================================================================ */

@media (min-width: 0px) {
  .max-bp0 {
    display: none !important;
  }
}

...

@media (min-width: 1400px) {
  .max-bp5 {
    display: none !important;
  }
}
```

**Ex:** to show an element **only** when the resolution is **at most** the value definted by the **$breakpoint-3** variable, we would use the **.max-bp3** class.

```css
/* Show only when resolution is at least X
================================================================ */

@media (max-width: 0px) {
  .min-bp0 {
    display: none !important;
  }
}

...

@media (max-width: 1400px) {
  .min-bp5 {
    display: none !important;
  }
}
```

**Ex:** to show an element **only** when the resolution is **at least** the value defined by the **$breakpoint-3** variable, we would use the **.min-bp3** class.

---

### Using Helper Classes Semantically

The easiest way to use these helper classes is by simply adding them straight to your HTML element, which is fine in most cases, but may result in [unsemantic code](http://css-tricks.com/semantic-class-names/). It is possible to use the helper classes within another, semantically named class by [extending them](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#extend) with SASS.

#### Example

```css
/*********************
CLEARFIXIN
*********************/

.clearfix, .cf {
    zoom: 1;
    &:before, &:after { 
    	content: ""; 
    	display: table; 
    }
    &:after { 
    	clear: both; 
    }
}
```

```html
<div class="top-features cf">
	...
</div>
```

The above example shows the simplest case of using the provided [clearfix](http://nicolasgallagher.com/micro-clearfix-hack/) solution to handle floated elements. Whilst the above example is perfectly valid code, it is not semantic. To use this clearfix class (or any helper class) semantically, you should extend the class into your main class like so:

```css
/*********************
Top Features
*********************/

.top-features {
	...
	@extend .cf;
}
```

```html
<div class="top-features">
	...
</div>
```

This results is cleaner and more semantic HTML markup, and we recommend using all helper classes in this way where possible.

---

### Normalize

[Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/) makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing. It is a native feautre of the [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), which One Nexus is built on. The normalize SCSS partial is located in the **skeleton** folder:

```html
assets > styles > scss > skeleton > _normalize.scss
```

---

### Print Styles

One Nexus comes with a custom stylesheet for printed media. It is a native feautre of the HTML5 Boilerplate, which One Nexus is built on. The print SCSS partial is located in the **skeleton** folder:

```html
assets > styles > scss > skeleton > _print.scss
```

From the [H5BP documentation](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/v4.3.0/doc/css.md#print-styles):

* We strip all background colors, change the font color to black and remove text-shadow. This is meant to help save printer ink and make the printing process much faster.
* Anchors do not need colors to indicate they are linked. They are underlined to indicate so.
* Anchors and Abbreviations are expanded to indicate where users reading the printed page can refer to.
* But we do not want to show link text for image replaced elements (given that they are primarily images).

---

### Variables

One of the most useful features of SASS is the ability to pass variables in your CSS. One Nexus contains all of its variables in one convenient location. The variables SCSS partial is located in the **skeleton** folder:

```html
assets > styles > scss > skeleton > _variables.scss
```
---

#### Skeleton

The skeleton variables are the variables which control how your project's framework is built. To learn how these variables work with your project, read the [Responsive Grid System](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/features/responsive-grid-system/) help page.

```css
/******************************************************************
Skeleton
******************************************************************/

$main-width       :   1200px;
$max-width        :   90%;

$columns          :   12;
$gutter           :   2.5%;

/*****************************************************************/
```

##### Main Width ($main-width)

This is where you set the width for the main site container - pretty self-explanatory. This variable can be any numeric value; pixels, percentage, em or rem.

##### Max Width ($max-width)

This variable sets the maximum allowed width for the main site container, and will override the previous **$main-width** variable where applicable. It is recommended you use a high percentage for this value, as this is what stops the page from being too wide on smaller resolutions.

##### Columns ($columns)

This is where you can set the number of columns for your grid. Twelve is popularly accepted as the number to use as it is divisible by 2, 3, 4 and 6, allowing for a more flexible system. Feel free to override this if you know what you're doing, our math will calculate your grid no matter the value you enter here.

##### Gutter ($gutter)

The gutter is the gap between each column. As our grid system uses percentage widths, the value you enter here must be a percentage and will not work if you enter a px value.

---

#### Breakpoints

Breakpoints are what allow you to style your CSS for a specific selection of browser widths. They work by using **CSS media queries**. You can set as many of these as you like and set them to whatever values you think are suitable for your project.

By default each column expands to 100% width when the resolution is less than **$breakpoint-3**.

```css
/******************************************************************
Breakpoints
******************************************************************/

$breakpoint-0     :   0px;
$breakpoint-1     :   460px;
$breakpoint-2     :   720px;
$breakpoint-3     :   940px;
$breakpoint-4     :   1200px;
$breakpoint-5     :   1400px;

$bp-values        :   $breakpoint-0, $breakpoint-1, $breakpoint-2, $breakpoint-3, $breakpoint-4, $breakpoint-5;

$bp-names         :   bp0, bp1, bp2, bp3, bp4, bp5;

/*****************************************************************/
```

The **$bp-values** and **$bp-names** variables are used to generate classes for the [custom column collapsing](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/features/responsive-grid-system/#custom-column-collapsing) feature. To read about how to customize and create your own mobile-first responsive modules using these breakpoint values, header over to the [modules](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/modules) page.

---

#### Typography

The **tyography** variables control your project's fonts and font sizes. By default the font-sizes are applied only to the main body element, with the **$small-font-size** being used for portable devices.

Visit the [Base](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/skeleton/base/) help page to learn more about how the body element uses these variables.

```css
/******************************************************************
Typography
******************************************************************/

/* Fonts */

$font-1           :   "Lato", sans-serif;
$font-2           :   "Droid Serif", serif;

$sans-serif       :   "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
$serif            :   "Georgia", Cambria, Times New Roman, Times, serif;

/* Font Sizes */

$base-font-size   :   1rem;
$small-font-size  :   $base-font-size * 0.85;

******************************************************************/
```

Only the font names are defined here. You still need to load the actual [font files](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/elements/typography/fonts/).

---

#### Color Palette

These variables control the color scheme of yout project. You can quickly and simply change the entire color of your whole website just by changing a couple of variables. By default there are three different palettes - feel free to delete any you don't need.

##### Greyscale Colors

This palette has six different shades ranging from white to black.

```css
/* Greyscale Colors */

$white            :   #ffffff;
$dark-white       :   #f1f1f1;
$light-grey       :   #b1b1b1;
$grey             :   #707070;
$dark-grey        :   #1C1C1C;
$black            :   #000000;

$greyscale-colors :   $white, $light-grey, $grey, $dark-grey, $black;
$greyscale-names  :   white, light-grey, grey, dark-grey, black;
```

##### Brand Colors

This palette is for your brand colors, which are typically used for the main theming and styling colors of your website.

```css
/* Brand Colors */

$brand-1          :   #008db6;
$brand-2          :   #0fa28c;
$brand-3          :	  #b93362;

$brand-colors     :   $brand-1, $brand-2, $brand-3;
$brand-names      :   brand-1, brand-2, brand-3;
```

##### Alert Colors

This palette contains a standard set of colors useful for various things such as our Alert Bars.

```css
/* Alert Colors */

$help             :   #e7d16c;
$danger           :   #CB8888;
$success          :   #9cc079;
$info             :   #79a9c0;

$alert-colors     :   $help, $danger, $success, $info;
$alert-names      :   help, danger, success, info;
```

The **x-colors** and **x-names** variables are used to generate the [button sets](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/elements/general/buttons/) for your project.

#### Theming

This is where all your theme-specific variables should be placed. By default we only provide you with a select handful of common/useful ones to get going.

```css
/******************************************************************
Theming
******************************************************************/

$base-margin      :   1.5rem;

$main-text-color  :   $grey;
$background-color :   $dark-white;

/*****************************************************************/
```

## Elements

We see websites as being made up of visual "elements". The styling of these elements plays as large part in creating the look and feel of your website. One Nexus comes with a load of pre-made common elements to help structure the UI of your project.

Each main element has its own SASS partial which contains all variations of the element (where applicable). Any given element can be found in the **elements** folder located here:

```html
assets > styles > scss > elements > _your-element.scss
```

Every element must be included in the main **app.scss** file. All provided elements are included by default, and you are encouraged to remove any you don't need and add your own where necessary.

```css
/******************************************************************

Site Name: Website name here
Author: Your name/company here

******************************************************************/

/******************************************************************

### General Elements

These general elements can be thought of as the basic user interface elements for your website. Typically general elements are not used to present the main written content of a wesite (see [Typographic Elements](http://www.onenexusproject.com/elements/typography/)) but everything else a webpage is made up of.

---

#### Alert Bars

Alert bars are useful for displaying important messages to your visitors. One Nexus comes with two different types of alert bars, each with four different colors for different purposes. The alert-bars SCSS partial is located in the **elements** folder:

```html
assets > styles > scss > elements > _alert-bars.scss
```

##### Standard Alert Bars

You can turn any block level HTML element into an alert bar by adding the class **alert-x**, where **x** is either **help**, **danger**, **success** or **info**. These are the default [alert color variables](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/skeleton/variables/#color-palette) provided with One Nexus.

```html
<div class="alert-help">This is a <b>helpful</b> alert box.</div>
```

##### Alternative Alert Bars

Follow the directions for a regular alert-bar, but this time add the **alt** class to the element as well.

```html
<div class="alert-help alt">
	<h4 class="dotted"><strong><b>This is a helpful alert bar</b></strong></h4>
	<p>These alert bars are useful for displaying larger amounts of information to your visitors.</p>
</div>
```

---

#### Buttons

Buttons are one of the most common elements to appear on websites, so it is important to have a re-usable and intuitive means of creating them and including them on the front end of your websites. One Nexus comes with a load of different button styles for you to use in the various colors defined in the [variables](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/skeleton/variables/#color-palette) partial. The buttons SCSS partial is located in the **elements** folder:

```html
assets > styles > scss > elements > _buttons.scss
```

##### Basic Example

To create a button simply add the class **button** to any inline HTML element.

```html
<a class="button" href="#">Button</a>
```

---

##### Size Variants

By default One Nexus comes with three button sizes; **small**, **regular** and **large**. Adding additional sizes is simple; simply open up the _buttons.scss partial, find the **Size Variants** section and duplicate one of the rules with your new information. Since the buttons use **em**'s for padding, you can resize the entire button by changing only the button's **font-size**. 

###### Large Buttons

To create a large button simply add the class **large** to your button element.

```html
<a class="button large" href="#">Large Button</a>
```

###### Regular Buttons

This is just the default button size, so no extra markup is required.

```html
<a class="button" href="#">Button</a>
```

###### Small Buttons

To create a small button simply add the class **small** to your button element.

```html
<a class="button small" href="#">Small Button</a>
```

---

##### Style Variants

One Nexus comes with 4 additional button styles to accommodate the most common uses. To create a new button style for your project, simply open up the **_buttons.scss** partial, find the **Style Variants** section and duplicate one of the rules with your new information.

###### Border Buttons

To create a border button, simply add the class **border** to your button element.

```html
<a class="button border" href="#">Border Button</a>
```

###### Disabled Buttons

To create a disabled button, simply add the class **disabled** to your button element.

```html
<a class="button disabled" href="#">Disabled Button</a>
```

###### Full-Width Buttons

To create a full-width button, simply add the class **full-width** to your button element.

```html
<a class="button full-width" href="#">Full-Width Button</a>
```

###### Round Buttons

To create a round button, simply add the class **round** to your button element.

```html
<a class="button round" href="#">Round Button</a>
```

---

##### Color Variants

One Nexus automatically generates a button for each color you have defined in the brand and alert Color Palettes. The easiest way to create a new colored button is to add your desired color to one of those palettes.

###### Brand buttons

To create a branded button, simply add the class brand-x to your button element, where x corresponds to your [brand color variable](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/skeleton/variables/#color-palette).

```html
<a class="button brand-1" href="#">Brand-1 Button</a>
```

###### Alert buttons

To create an alert button, simply add the class **help**, **danger**, **success** or **info** to your button element.

```html
<a class="button help" href="#">Help Button</a>
```

---

##### Combining Styles

To combine button styles, simply add your desired style classes to your button element.

```html
<a class="button large round full-width disabled brand-1" href="#">
	Large Round Full-Width Disabled Brand-1 Button
</a>
```

---

#### Forms

One Nexus makes use of the HTML5 input attribute types as well as other new HTML5 features. These features simply get ignored by older browsers meaning they will still work as they otherwise would. The forms SCSS partial is located in the **elements** folder:

```html
assets > styles > scss > elements > _forms.scss
```

##### Basic Example

To apply the basic input field styles to a form element, simply add the class **box** to the element. You should add this class to every input/textarea/select etc. in your form.

```html
...
<input type="text" class="box">
<select class="box">
    ...
</select>
...
```

You should group each label and input combination in **section** HTML tags.

```html
...
<section>
    <label>Last Name</label>
    <input type="text" class="box">
</section>
...
```

---

##### Framework Implementation

Usng the One Nexus [Grid System](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/features/responsive-grid-system/) you can get creative by making forms for various purposes.

###### Login Form

```html
<form class="span-6">
    <section class="row">
        <label class="span-3 va-middle">Username:</label>
        <div class="span-9 va-middle">
            <input type="text" placeholder="Enter your username" class="box">
        </div>
    </section>
    <section class="row">
        <label class="span-3 va-middle">Password:</label>
        <div class="span-9 va-middle">
            <input type="password" placeholder="Enter your password" class="box">
        </div>
    </section>
    <section class="row">
        <label class="span-9 va-middle">
          <input type="checkbox"> Remember Me
        </label>
        <br class="margin-sep max-bp3">
        <div class="span-3 va-middle text-right">
            <input type="submit" value="Login">
        </div>
    </section>
</form>
```

---

#### Icons

One Nexus comes with [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) installed by default, giving you access to over 400 vector icons. The icons SCSS partial is located in the **elements** folder:


```html
assets > styles > scss > elements > _icons.scss
```

One Nexus references the [CDN version](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/#fontawesome_tab) of Font Awesome by default, but also comes with an optional self hosted version.

---

##### Basic Example

Font Awesome is already well documented on their own website, so we won't go into too much detail about how to use it. If you do require more information about how to use Font Awesome, [visit their website](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/).

```html
<i class="fa fa-desktop"></i>
```

**Tip:** When targeting font-awesome icons in your custom CSS modules, use the .fa selector, not the i selector.

---

##### Using With Buttons

One of the most common use cases of Font Awesome is for creating buttons with icons. Creating a basic button with an icon is simple with One Nexus, just add the icon markup inside your [button](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/elements/general/buttons/) markup, next to the button text. 

```html
<a class="button brand-2" href="#">
	<i class="fa fa-car"></i> Button With Icon
</a>
```

---

##### Social Buttons

Thanks to the inclusion of various brand icons with Font Awesome, we have created a set of premade social buttons and icons for you to use on your website. We created them to be as minimal as possible whilst still being visually appealing, so you can either leave them as they are, or build on them to create your own.

###### Default Social Buttons

To create a social button simply add the social class to an HTML element, along with one of the following brand classes:

* facebook
* twitter
* linkedin
* github
* skype
* pinterest
* instagram
* rss
* youtube
* flickr
* vimeo
* dribbble
* behance
* deviantart

```html
<a href="#" class="social facebook"></a>
```

###### Social Buttons With Text

To create a social button with text, create a regular social button and add the text class to your element.

```html
<a href="#" class="social facebook text"></a>
```

You do not need to add the brand text in your markup - it is handled through CSS pseudo selectors.

###### Small Social Buttons

To create a small social button, simply create your social button and add the **small** class to the element.

```html
<a href="#" class="social facebook small"></a>
```

###### Large Social Buttons

To create a large social button, simply create your social button and add the large class to the element.

```html
<a href="#" class="social facebook large"></a>
```

The different social button sizes have been made to match those of the [regular buttons](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/elements/general/buttons/).

---

#### Images

One of the most common elements for web pages is images, and they can come in all different shapes and sizes. There is nothing fancy here - just a few helpful classes to get you started. The images SCSS partial is located in the elements folder:

```html
assets > styles > scss > elements > _images.scss
```

---

##### Responsive Images

By default, any image you include on you page with One Nexus is responsive, thanks to the following CSS properties:

```css
max-width: 100%;
height: auto;
```

---

##### Style Variants

###### Thumbnails

To create a thumbnail, simply add the class **thumbnail** to your image element.

```html
<img class="thumbnail" width="250" src="/assets/images/further-bg.jpg">
```

Adding this class does not affect the size of the image.

---

##### Shape Variants

###### Turn any image into a responsive square

Creating a perfectly squared container which is also responsive to hold a rectangular image whilst preserving the aspect ratio can be tricky business. By creating a container for your image and adding the class **responsive-square** you no longer have to worry. This is useful for when you need to create squared images in your layout from rectangular images, such as the below example.

```html
<div class="responsive-square">		
	<img src="/assets/images/further-bg.jpg">
</div>
```

The **responsive-square** container will always be 100% width of its parent's container.

###### Turn any image into a responsive circle

Making any image render as a complete circle is extremely easy, even if the image is rectangular to begin with - just put your image inside a container element with the **responsive-circle** class.

```html
<div class="responsive-circle">		
	<img src="/assets/images/further-bg.jpg">
</div>
```

The **responsive-circle** container will always be 100% width of its parent's container.

---

#### Tables

Tables still hold an important role in modern websites, so we have provided you with a tables partial should you need it, which is located in the elements folder:

```html
assets > styles > scss > elements > _tables.scss
```

---

##### Basic Example

One Nexus comes with a minimalistic table styleset for you to build upon; but which still looks great by default. Without any special markup, this here's a default table example:

```html
<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<td colspan="3">Table Header</td>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>COLOR</td>
			<td>NUMBER</td>
			<td>VEHICLE</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>blue</td>
			<td>24</td>
			<td>car</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>green</td>
			<td>38</td>
			<td>bike</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>red</td>
			<td>55</td>
			<td>train</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
	<tfoot>
		<tr>
			<td colspan="3">Table Footer</td>
		</tr>
	</tfoot>
</table>
```

---

##### Fixed columns

To make it so each column in your table has fixed column widths for a more consistent look, simply add the class **table-fixed** to the main **table** element.

```html
<table class="table-fixed">
	<tbody>
		<!-- table content -->
		...
	</tbody>
</table>
```

---

### Interactive Elements

These are all the interactive elements that come with One Nexus. An interactive element is any element which requires user engagement and affects the page content. Typically an interative element will also have some accompanying [jQuery code](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/features/jquery/).

---

#### Accordions

Accordions are a great way to convey information without taking up too much space. Our custom accordions are dynamic, minimalistic and flexible. The accordions SCSS partial is located in the **elements** folder:


```html
assets > styles > scss > elements > _accordions.scss
```

The accordions also requires the **accordion.js** [jQuery file](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/features/jquery/) to function.

---

##### Basic Example

The One Nexus accordions are built to be as dynamic as possible - meaning they do not require any specific markup. They just need to be in the correct format and wrapped in a container with the class **accordion**. A typical accordion HTML strucutre may look something like this:

```html
<div class="accordion">
	<section>
		<h4>Accordion Title 1</i></h4>
		<article>
			<!-- accordion content -->
		</article>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>Accordion Title 2</h4>
		<article>
			<!-- accordion content -->
		</article>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>Accordion Title 3</h4>
		<article>
			<!-- accordion content -->
		</article>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>Accordion Title 4</h4>
		<article>
			<!-- accordion content -->
		</article>
	</section>
</div>
```
Any of the above HTML tags (**div**, **section**, **h4**, **article** & **p**) can be anything, but for stability and semantics we recommend keeping the above strucutre as it is, or at the very least stick to **div**'s.

---

##### Open by Default

To have an accordion item open by defalt, simply add the class **active** to the main item container, and add an **inline-style** of **display: block**; to the item content's container. Using the markup from our example, we would add the active class to the **section**, and the inline-style to the **article**. 

```html
<div class="accordion">
	...
	<section class="active">
		<h4>Accordion Title 1</h4>
		<article style="display: block;">
			<p>Accordion Content.</p>
		</article>
	</section>
	...
</div>	
```
---

##### Multiple Open Items

To create accordions where you can have more then one item open at once, just put each item in a seperate container with the **accordion** class.

```html
<div class="accordion">
	<section>
		<h4>Accordion Title 1</h4>
		<article>
			<p>Accordion content.</p>
		</article>
	</section>
</div>
<div class="accordion">
	<section>
		<h4>Accordion Title 1</h4>
		<article>
			<p>Accordion content.</p>
		</article>
	</section>
</div>
<div class="accordion">
	<section>
		<h4>Accordion Title 1</h4>
		<article>
			<p>Accordion content.</p>
		</article>
	</section>
</div>
```
---

#### Carousels

We chose to include the popular [Owl-Carousel](http://owlgraphic.com/owlcarousel/) jQuery plugin with One Nexus to handle all of your carousel needs, but you can easily swap this for another plugin of your choice. The accompanying carousels SCSS partial is located in the **elements** folder:

```html
assets > styles > scss > elements > _carousels.scss
```

The Owl-Carousel jQuery is located in the **slider.js** [jQuery file](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/features/jquery/).

Owl-Carousel is already very well documented on [their website](http://owlgraphic.com/owlcarousel/), so we will only cover the basics here.

---

##### Basic Example

To create a carousel, simply create a set of HTML elements wrapped in a container:

```html
<div class="example-slider">
    <section>
        <!-- slide 1 content -->
    </section>
    <section>
        <!-- slide 2 content -->
    </section>
    <section>
        <!-- slide 3 content -->
    </section>
    <section>
        <!-- slide 4 content -->
    </section>
</div>
```
You then need to call the jQuery plugin on your container, setting your desired carousel options:

```javascript
$(document).ready(function() {

    $(".example-slider").owlCarousel({ 
        navigation : true, 
        slideSpeed : 600,
        singleItem:true,
        navigationText : false,
        autoPlay : 10000,
        stopOnHover : true,
    });

}); // End document.ready
```

Make sure to call the plugin inside a **document.ready** function as shown in the above example.

For a full list of available options for your carousel (which there's a lot of!) visit the [Owl-Carousel](http://owlgraphic.com/owlcarousel/) homepage.

---

##### Replacing the Owl-Carousel Plugin

You may prefer to use a different plugin for your carousels - that's fine, One Nexus has your back. Typically a third party jQuery plugin will come with some script and some CSS. To keep things intuitive, we want the carousel styles to be contained within the **_carousels.scss** partial. If your alternative carousel has its own CSS, simply overwrite the CSS in this partial with your carousel's CSS - regular CSS works just fine in .scss files. Next, do the same for your carousel's JS - copy and paste your new script into the **carousel.js** file, overwriting the old code. Your new carousel plugin is now installed!

---

#### Modal Windows

Modals are always useful, and if used properly can really enhance the user experience of your website. They can be used to enlarge images, create image galleries, load content without loading another page etc. One Nexus uses the [Magnific Popup](http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/) jQuery plugin but can easily be switched to another plugin of your choice. The modals SCSS partial is located in the **elements** folder:

```html
assets > styles > scss > elements > _modals.scss
```

The plugin's jQuery is located in the **modal.js** [jQuery file](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/features/jquery/).

This plugin is already well documented on its [homepage](http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/), so only the basics will be covered here.

---

##### Modal Image

To crate a modal image, simply wrap your image in anchor tags linking to the full-sized imag and add the **modal-image** class.

```html
<a class="modal-image" href="/assets/images/further-bg.jpg">
	<img class="thumbnail" width="300" src="/assets/images/further-bg.jpg" />
</a>
```
For added effect, we have added the [**thumbnail** class](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/elements/general/images/) to our images in the above example.

Alternativly, you can manually call the jQuery plugin on an image (so you don't need to add any extra markup). Again, make sure your image is wrapped in anchor tags linking to your main image, and target the anchor element like so:

```javascript
$("#your-link").magnificPopup({ 
	type: "image"
});
```
---

##### Modal Gallery

Using the modal plugin with the [responsive grid system](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/features/responsive-grid-system/) that comes with One Nexus, you can create interactive modal galleries. Using our predefined calls, you can add the **modal-gallery** class to any container which contains the links to your images.

```html
<div class="row modal-gallery">
	<div class="span-3">
		<a href="/assets/images/further-bg.jpg">
			<img class="thumbnail" src="/assets/images/further-bg.jpg" />
		</a>
	</div>
	<div class="span-3">
		<a href="/assets/images/further-bg.jpg">
			<img class="thumbnail" src="/assets/images/further-bg.jpg" />
		</a>
	</div>
	<div class="span-3">
		<a href="/assets/images/further-bg.jpg">
			<img class="thumbnail" src="/assets/images/further-bg.jpg" />
		</a>
	</div>
	<div class="span-3">
		<a href="/assets/images/further-bg.jpg">
			<img class="thumbnail" src="/assets/images/further-bg.jpg" />
		</a>
	</div>
</div>
```

Alternatively, you can manually convert a set of links into a modal gallery by calling the jQuery plugin on the container which contains the links to your images.

```javascript
$("#your-container").magnificPopup({ 
	type: "image",
	delegate: "a",
	gallery: {
		enabled: true
	},
});
```
For more available options please visit the [plugin's homepage](http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/).

---

##### Inline Html Content

To create a custom modal box with HTML content, you first need to create your modal box HTML content anywhere on the page where the modal is being called. It is recommended that you create the element at the top or bottom of your page, but as it will be hidden by default, it doesn't really matter where it's placed.

The container for your HTML needs to be given a custom ID, unique to that element. In our example, we wil use #example-modal (pretty original, right?). The modal-content class also needs to be added to the same container - this hides the box by default and adds styles to our box.

```html
<div id="example-modal" class="modal-content">
	<div>
		<h2>Modal Content</h2>
		<p><!-- modal content --></p>
	</div>
</div>
```

To call the modal and open it, you just need to create an anchor linking to the box using the custom ID you set before, and apply the **inline-modal** class.

```html
<a class="inline-modal" href="#example-modal">Open Modal</a>
```

To find out more about the **Magnific Popup** plugin and read about its other features, visit [their website](http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/).

---

##### Replacing the Magnific Popup Plugin

You may prefer to use a different plugin for your modals - that's fine, One Nexus has your back. Typically a third party jQuery plugin will come with some script and some CSS. To keep things intuitive, we want the modal styles to be contained within the _modals.scss partial. If your alternative modal plugin has its own CSS, simply overwrite the CSS in this partial with your modal's CSS - regular CSS works just fine in .scss files. Next, do the same for your modal's JS - copy and paste your new script into the modal.js file, overwriting the old code. Your new modal plugin is now installed!

---

#### Tabs

Tabs are a great way to convey information without taking up too much space. Our custom tabs are dynamic, minimalistic and flexible. The tabs SCSS partial is located in the **elements** folder:


```html
assets > styles > scss > elements > _element.scss
```

The tabs also requires the **tabs.js** [jQuery file](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/features/jquery/) to function.

---

##### Basic Example

Creating a set of tabs requires two things; a tab navigation to switch between tabs, and the tab contents. The tab navigation is just an unordered list with the **nav** class. You should also add the **active** class to the item you want shown by default (typically the first item). Next, create a set of **section** tags, one for each tab item. You can than put any HTML content you desire for your tabs. Again, add the **active** class to the section you want shown by defauly. Finally, all of that needs to be wrapped up in a container with the **tabs** class.

```html
<div class="tabs">
    <ul class="nav">
        <li class="active">Tab 1</li>
        <li>Tab 2</li>
        <li>Tab 3</li>
    </ul>
    <section class="active">              
        <!-- tab 1 content -->
    </section>
    <section>              
        <!-- tab 1 content -->
    </section>
    <section>              
        <!-- tab 1 content -->
    </section>
</div>
```

---

##### Full-Width Navigation

To create a set of tabs with full-width navigation items like in the above example, all you need to do is add the **full** class to your main tabs container:

```html
<div class="tabs full">
    <ul class="nav">
        <li class="active">Tab 1</li>
        <li>Tab 2</li>
        <li>Tab 3</li>
    </ul>
    <section class="active">              
        <!-- tab 1 content -->
    </section>
    <section>              
        <!-- tab 1 content -->
    </section>
    <section>              
        <!-- tab 1 content -->
    </section>
</div>
```

Tooltips are always useful, and if used properly can really enhance the user experience. The simple tooltip plugin provided with One Nexus is called [Tipr](http://www.tipue.com/tipr/). The tooltips SCSS partial is located in the **elements** folder:

```html
assets > styles > scss > elements > _tooltips.scss
```

The tooltips also requires the **tooltip.js** [jQuery file](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/features/jquery/) to function.

---

##### Basic Example

To add a tooltip to an element, simply add the **tooltip** class along with a **data-tip** attribute containing your tooltip content.

```html
<a class="social facebook tooltip" data-tip="Facebook" href="#"></a>
```

**Tip:** You can include HTML inside the **data-tip** attribute.

---

##### Bottom Tooltip

To create a tooltip undrneath your element, simply create a regular tooltip and add the **tooltip-bottom** class.

```html
<a class="social dribbble tooltip tooltip-bottom" data-tip="Dribbble" href="#"></a>
```

---

### Typographic Elements

Typographic elements are what make up the main written content for your website and is where you should place all elements relating to typography.

---

#### Fonts

Whether your using a web font service like [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) or self-hosting your fonts, you need to reference the font file somewhere. We chose to conduct this within our CSS by using **@import**. The fonts SCSS partial is located in the elements folder:


```html
assets > styles > scss > elements > _fonts.scss
```

The actual font-family names are declared in the project's [variables](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/skeleton/variables/) by default, but feel free to move them here.

---

##### Adding/Replacing Fonts

By default there are two fonts included with One Nexus. You should use the first option for your project's primary font (which in our case is the [Lato](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lato) Google Font), and then either delete/amend/add more fonts as desired.

```css
/******************************************************************
Font 1
******************************************************************/

@import url(http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:300,400,700,900);

.font-1 {
    font-family: $font-1;
}

/*****************************************************************/
```

Then in the **[variables partial](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/skeleton/variables/)**, we have the above **$font-1** variable, which we have assigned to a re-usable **font-1** class. You can of course then add the font to any element in your CSS by adding **font-family: $font-1;** as shown above.

```css
/******************************************************************
Typography
******************************************************************/

/* Fonts */

$font-1           :   "Lato", sans-serif;
$font-2           :   "Droid Serif", serif;

$sans-serif       :   "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
$serif            :   "Georgia", Cambria, Times New Roman, Times, serif;

/* Font Sizes */

$base-font-size   :   1rem;
$small-font-size  :   $base-font-size * 0.85;

******************************************************************/
```

---

#### Headings

One Nexus takes a slightly different approach to handling headings. Rather than using the individual h1, h2, h3 etc. tags for different, specific types of headings, we leave them all unstyled by default (exscept for their size and weight as applied by default), and then apply different styles using semantic HTML tags (for the most part). The headings SCSS partial is located in the **elements** folder:


```html
assets > styles > scss > elements > _headings.scss
```

---

##### Uppercase Heading

To create an uppercase heading, simply wrap the text in your heading with **strong** HTML tags.

```html
<h3><strong>This is an uppercase H3 title</strong></h3>
```

---

##### Thin Text Heading

To create a heading with thin text, simply wrap the text in your heading with **em** HTML tags.

```html
<h3><em>This is a thin text H3 title</em></h3>
```

---

##### Heading with Custom Font

To create a heading with a custom font, simply add the class **font-x** to your heading element, replacing **x** with your desired font, as defined by the [fonts SCSS partial](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/elements/typography/fonts/).

This requires you to set up the [re-usable font classes](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/elements/typography/fonts/) for your fonts, as done by the default fonts.

```html
<h3 class="font-2">This is an H3 title with a custom font</h3>
```

---
##### Colorful Heading

To create a heading with colored text, simply wrap the text in your heading with **i** HTML tags.

```html
<h3><i>This is a colorful H3 title</i></h3>
```

---
##### Highlighted Heading

To create a heading with a highlighted background, add the **highlight** class to your heading element, and then wrap the text in your heading with **b** HTML tags.

```html
<h3 class="highlight"><b>This is a highlighted H3 title</b></h3>
```

---

##### Mixing & Matching

By creating these basic predifined heading styles, we can then mix-and-match them to create even more variations.

```html
<h4 class="highlight"><b><em><strong>This is a highlighted heading with thin, uppercase text</strong></em></b></h4>
```

Of course, this may get a bit tedious, and to reduce the amount of required markup, you may wish to define your heading styles on a per-module basis.

---

#### Links

Links need to be differenciated from regular text so your users know they are clikable. By default One Nexus only styles regular anchor tags, but you can use this partial to add any other link styles your project may require. The links SCSS partial is located in the **elements** folder:

```html
assets > styles > scss > elements > _links.scss
```

---

##### Default Link Style

By default, a link is styled the color of the [**brand-1** variable](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/skeleton/variables/) with any **text-decoration** removed. When a link is hovered we then apply a **text-decoration** of **underline**.

```html
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet <a href="#">this is a link</a> consectetuer mollis sapien urna ut a. Eu nonummy <a href="#">this is another link</a> condimentum fringilla tempor pretium platea vel nibh netus Maecenas.</p>
```

It is common to use [button elements](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/elements/general/buttons/) on anchor tags to create call-to-actions.

---

#### Lists

Lists are one of the most common types of HTML element, and can be used for many different purposes. One Nexus comes with several different types of lists for different occasions. The lists SCSS partial is located in the **elements** folder:

```html
assets > styles > scss > elements > _lists.scss
```

---

##### Reset Lists

A **reset-list** is a list whose **ul** element has its margin, padding and list-style reset, ie - removed. This is useful when, for example, creating menus.

```css
ul.reset, ol.reset {
	margin: 0;
	padding: 0;
	list-style: none;
}
```

There are two ways to utilise this list. The best way is to use the [@extend](http://css-tricks.com/the-extend-concept/) feature of SASS, by extending the reset class into your module, as shown in the example below. The alternative way is to simply add the **reset** class to your **ul** or **ol** element.

```css
.your-module {

	ul {
		@extend ul.reset;
		/* Your list styles */
	}

} /* End .your-module */
```

---

##### Block Lists

Block lists are a great way to make your items stand out. Perfect for things like a list of features or benefits of your product or services. Converting a regular list to a block list is extremely simple. Either use the [@extend](http://css-tricks.com/the-extend-concept/) SASS feature by extending the **block-list** class into your module, or add the **block-list class** to your list.

```css
.your-module {

	ul {
		@extend .block-list;
		/* Your list styles */
	}

} /* End .your-module */
```

---

#### Quotes

One Nexus comes with a clean, default style for **blockquote** elements, ready for you to build upon. The blockquotes SCSS partial is located in the **elements** folder:

```html
assets > styles > scss > elements > _blockquotes.scss
```

---

##### Basic Example

To create a blockquote (with optional **cite** tag), simply create a paragraph with **p** HTML tags wrapped in **blockquote** html tags.

```html
<blockquote>
	<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetuer mollis sapien urna ut a... <cite>- John Doe</cite></p>
</blockquote>
```

---

## Modules

Each web page can be considered to be a group of modules in a grid which contain the website's content. A module is typically the layout and structure of one or more [elements](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/elements/) to form a specific section of a web page.

The default modules which come with One Nexus are designed to be as minimal as possible, allowing you to build on them and add your own styles rather than having to removing a load of styles you don't need. Each module has its own SASS partial which is located in the **modules** folder located here:

```html
assets > styles > scss > modules > _your-module.scss
```

Every module must be included in the main **app.scss** file &#42;. All provided modules are included by default, and you are encouraged to remove any you don't need and add your own where neccessery.

*&#42;Except for [Nexted Modules](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/modules/#nested-modules)*

```css
/******************************************************************

Site Name: Website name here
Author: Your name/company here

******************************************************************/

/******************************************************************
Skeleton
******************************************************************/

...

/******************************************************************
Elements
******************************************************************/

...

/******************************************************************
Modules
******************************************************************/

@import "modules/breadcrumb";
@import "modules/footer";
@import "modules/header";
@import "modules/logo";
@import "modules/main-nav";
@import "modules/off-canvas-nav";
@import "modules/scroll-top";
```

---

### Nested Modules

It is possible to nest smaller modules within larger modules. Sometimes this may be done out of personal preference, and in few cases may even be beneficial. The below is an example of the latter from the **main-nav** module from One Nexus. This module also contains nested within it the **dropdown-nav** module.

```css
.main-nav {

	ul {
	    li {
			display: inline-block;
			position: relative;
	    	/* Import the dropdown nav */
	    	@import "dropdown-nav";
	    }
	}

} // End .main-nav 
```

Because the nested module is being included in the main module, it does not need to be included in **app.scss**.

---

### Creating a Mobile-First Responsive Module

Below is an example of how to build a mobile first responsive module using our defined breakpoints. The concept is simple; start out with the core CSS for the module and then gradually add styles for larger resolutions.

```css
/* Main Slider
================================================================ */

.main-slider {

/******************************************************************
Start building the basic layout for lowest resoluton
******************************************************************/

	background-color: $grey;	
	color: white;
	position: relative;
	section {		
		height: 375px;
		background-color: $brand-1;
		background-image: url(../../images/slide-1-bg.jpg);
		background-repeat: no-repeat;
		background-position: center top;
	}

/******************************************************************
Start building for larger resolutions
******************************************************************/

	/*These styles will take affect when the resolution is at least 
	as wide as the value defined by the $breakpoint-3 variable */
	@media (min-width: $breakpoint-3) {
		section {
			height: 450px;
		}
	}

	/*These styles will take affect when the resolution is at least 
	as wide as the value defined by the $breakpoint-4 variable */
	@media (min-width: $breakpoint-4) {
		section {
			background-size: cover;
		}
	}

} // End .main-slider
```

---

### Breadcrumb

Breadcrumbs are a simple and common feature of many websites. One Nexus comes with a basic breadcrumb module ready for you to build on. The breadcrumb SCSS partial is located in the **modules** folder:

```html
assets > styles > scss > modules > _breadcrumb.scss
```

---

##### The HTML Markup

```html
<nav class="breadcrumb">
	<ul>
		<li><a href="/">One Nexus</a></li>
		<li><a href="/documentation/">Documentation</a></li>
		<li><a href="/documentation/modules/">Modules</a></li>
		<li>Breadcrumb</li>
	</ul>
</nav>
```

The markup for a breadcrumb is a simple un-ordered list wrapped in an element with a **breadcrumb** class.

---

##### The CSS

```css
/* Breadcrumb
======================================================================= */

.breadcrumb {	

	font-size: 0.9em;
	margin-bottom: $base-margin;
	ul {
		@extend ul.reset;
	}
	li {
		display: inline;
		&:not(:last-child) {
			margin-right: 0.2em;
			&:after {
				content: "\f105";
				font-family: FontAwesome;
				margin-left: 0.4em;
			}
		}
	}

} // End .breadcrumb
```

###### Code Analysis

* We make the font size slightly smaller than the base font at **0.9em**, and apply a margin-bottom to match other block elments using the **$base-margin** variable.

* We remove the default **padding**, **margin** and **list-style** from the **ul** by extending **[ul.reset](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/elements/typography/lists/)**.

* We make our list-items display **inline** to each other.

* We space the list-items out by adding a **margin-right** of **0.2em** to all but the last list-item.

* We add a divider icon uing the **fa-angle-right** [Font Awesome](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/elements/general/icons/) icon to all but the last list-item.

---

### Header 

Most, if not all, websites have a header and footer; these are the two most common modules. One Nexus comes with a pre-made header ready for you to customize. The header SCSS partial is located in the **modules** folder:

```html
assets > styles > scss > modules > _header.scss
```

The **header** module makes use of two other modules: [_logo.scss](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/modules/logo/) and [_main-nav.scss](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/modules/main-nav/).

---

##### The HTML Markup

```html
<header class="app-header" id="app-header">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="header-wrapper">
            <!-- Logo -->
            <div class="logo">
                <a href="/">
                    <img src="assets/images/logo.png" alt="One Nexus" />
                </a>
            </div>
            <!-- Main-Nav -->
            <nav class="main-nav">
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#">Header Link 1</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Header Link 2</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Header Link 3</a></li>
                </ul>
            </nav>
            <!-- Mobile Menu Trigger Button -->
            <a class="nav-trigger max-bp3" href="#"></a>
        </div>
    </div>
</header>
```

The default header module consists of the [logo module](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/modules/logo/), the [main-nav](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/modules/logo/) module and the [off-canvas nav](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/modules/off-canvas-nav/) trigger button for mobile displays, all wrapped within a **container** element which is wrapped in the main **app-header** element.

The [off-canvas nav](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/modules/off-canvas-nav/) trigger button is its own seperate module and has its own SCSS partial. By default we add a Helper Class of max-bp3 to hide it on desktops.

For semantic purposes we recommend using the **&#60;header>** HTML5 element for your **header**'s wrapper element.

---

##### The CSS

```css
/* Header
================================================================ */

.app-header {

/******************************************************************
Start building the basic layout for lowest resoluton
******************************************************************/

	background-color: $dark-grey;

/******************************************************************
Start building for larger resolutions
******************************************************************/

	@media (min-width: $breakpoint-3) {
		.header-wrapper {			
			display: table;
			width: 100%;
		}	
		.logo, .main-nav {
			display: table-cell;
			vertical-align: middle;
		}
	}

} // End .app-header

```
Both the **[logo](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/modules/logo/)** and **[main-nav](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/modules/main-nav/)** each have their own SCSS file; they are **not** included in the header partial. 

###### Code Analysis

* We set the **background-color** for the entire header.

* We set our **header-wrapper** to act as a table to hold our [logo](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/modules/logo/) and [main-nav](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/modules/main-nav/) pseudo "table-cells" (see **line 22**).

* We align our [logo](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/modules/logo/) and [main-nav](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/modules/main-nav/) next to each other by adding **display: table-cell;** to them, and we set their **vertical-align** to **middle** (this is one of the bonuses of using display: table-cell over floating them).

---

### Footer

Most, if not all, websites have a header and footer; these are the two most common modules. One Nexus comes with a pre-made footer ready for you to customize. The footer SCSS partial is located in the **modules** folder:


```html
assets > styles > scss > modules > _footer.scss
```

---

##### The HTML Markup

```html
<footer class="app-footer">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="footer-wrapper">
            <!-- Copyright Section -->
            <h4 class="copyright">© Your Website 2014</h4>
            <!-- Footer Navigation -->
            <nav class="footer-nav">                
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#">Footer Link 1</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Footer Link 2</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Footer Link 3</a></li>
                </ul>
            </nav>
        </div>
    </div>
</footer>
```

The default footer module consists of a **class="copyright"** element and a **class="footer-nav"** element, all wrapped up in a **container** element inside the main **app-footer** element.

For semantic purposes we recommend using the **&#60;footer>** HTML5 element for your footer's wrapper element.

The **copyright** and **footer-nav** classes can be applied to any HTML element within **app-footer**.

---

##### The CSS

```css
/* Footer
======================================================================= */

.app-footer {

/******************************************************************
Start building the basic layout for lowest resoluton
******************************************************************/

	text-align: center;	
	margin-bottom: $base-margin;
	.footer-nav {
		ul {
		    @extend ul.reset;
		}
	    li {
		    display: inline-block;
		    &:not(:last-child) {
				margin-right: 1em;
		    }
	    }
	}

/******************************************************************
Start building for larger resolutions
******************************************************************/

	@media (min-width: $breakpoint-2) {
		.footer-wrapper {			
			display: table;
			width: 100%;
			text-align: left;
		}
		.copyright, .footer-nav {
			display: table-cell;
			vertical-align: middle;
		}
		.footer-nav {
			text-align: right;
		}
	}

} // End .app-footer
```

###### Code Analysis

* We add text-align: center to center the contents of the footer for mobile displays.

* We add margin-bottom: $base-margin to create space between the footer and the bottom of the page.

* We remove the default padding, margin and list-style from the footer nav items by extending ul.reset.

* We make our footer nav list-items display inline-block so that they align next to each other.

* We space the list-items out by adding a margin-right of 1em to all but the last footer nav item.

* We set our footer footer-wrapper to act as a table (to hold our copyright and footer nav pseudo "table-cells" (see line 35).

* We align our copyright section and footer nav next to each other by adding display: table-cell to them, and we set their vertical-align to middle (this is one of the bonuses of using display: table-cell over floating them).

* We align the menu to the right of the page by adding text-align: right to the footer nav.

---

### Logo

Your project is almost certain to have its logo somewhere on the page, either in one or more places such as the [page header](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/modules/header/). The logo SCSS partial is located in the **modules** folder:

```html
assets > styles > scss > modules > _logo.scss
```

---

##### The HTML Markup

The markup for the logo is simply an element with the **logo** class which containts either plain text or an **img** element referencing your logo file, wrapped in an anchor tag (which would typically link to your homepage).

###### Plain Text Logo

```html
<div class="logo">
    <a href="/">One Nexus</a>
</div>
```

###### Image Logo

```html
<div class="logo">
    <a href="/">				                
		<img src="/assets/images/logo.png" alt="One Nexus" />
    </a>
</div>
```

---

##### The CSS

```css
/* Logo
======================================================================= */

.logo {	

	padding: 1em 0;
	/* for plain text logos */
	a {
		color: white;
		display: inline-block;
		&:hover {
			text-decoration: none;
		}
	}
	/* for image logos */
	img {
		height: 34px;
		display: inline-block;
		vertical-align: middle;
	}

} // End .logo
```

###### Code Analysis

* We add a top and bottom **padding** to create a gap between the logo and header edges.

* The code here is for **plain-text** based logos, and by default has some basic styling applied.

* The code here is for **image** based logos, and set's the image as an **inline-block** that is vertically aligned to the **middle**. Set the height of your logo here.

---

### Main Navigation

For multi-paged websites your users will need a method of navigation. The default main nav module is highly flexible and customizable, and supports infinite multi-level dropdown menus. The main-nav SCSS partial is located in the **modules** folder:

```html
assets > styles > scss > modules > _main-nav.scss
```

This module also contains the **_dropdown-nav.scss** module.

---

##### The HTML Markup

###### Basic Example

```html
<nav class="main-nav">
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Lorem Ipsum</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Alpha Bravo</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Dolor Sit Amet</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>
```

###### With Multi-Level Dropdown Menu

```html
<nav class="main-nav">
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Lorem Ipsum</a></li>
        <li>
            <a href="#">Dropdown Menu</a>
            <ul>
            	<li><a href="#">Alpha Alpha</a></li>
            	<li><a href="#">Bravo Alpha</a></li>
            	<li>
            		<a href="#">Dropdown Alpha</a>
            		<ul>
		            	<li><a href="#">Alpha Bravo</a></li>
		            	<li><a href="#">Bravo Bravo</a></li>
		            	<li><a href="#">Charlie Bravo</a></li>
		            </ul>
            	</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><a href="#">Dolor Sit Amet</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>
```

The markup for the main navigation is a regular un-ordered list (which can accommodate an infinite number of sub-menus), wrapped up in an element with the **main-nav** class.

For semantic purposes we recommend using the **&#60;nav>** HTML5 element for your **navigation**'s wrapper element.

Whilst the mobile/off-canvas nav uses the same HTML markup as the main nav, it requires its own [seperate module](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/modules/off-canvas-nav/) for the CSS.

---

##### The Main Nav CSS

```css
/* Main Navigation
================================================================ */

.main-nav {

/******************************************************************
Start building the basic layout for lowest resoluton
******************************************************************/

	ul {
		@extend ul.reset;
		display: none;
		font-size: 0;
	    li {
		    @import "dropdown-nav";
		    ul {
		    	padding-left: 2em;
		    }  
		    &:hover {
		    	> a {		    		
					color: white;
					background: darken($brand-1, 10%);
		    	}
		    }
	    }
    	a {
			text-decoration: none;
			display: block;	
			line-height: 4em;
			color: $grey;
			padding: 0 1em;
			font-size: 1rem;
    	}
	}

/******************************************************************
Start building for larger resolutions
******************************************************************/

	@media (min-width: $breakpoint-3) {
		text-align: right;
		ul {
			white-space: nowrap;
		    li {
				display: inline-block;
				position: relative;
		    }
		}
		> ul {
			display: block;
		}
	}

} // End .main-nav
```

Note the inclusion of the **dropdown-nav** module in the above code.

###### Code Analysis

* We remove the default **padding**, **margin** and **list-style** from the **ul** by extending **[ul.reset](http://www.onenexusproject.com/documentation/elements/typography/lists/)**.

* Keep in mind we are still styling for the lowest resolution, we want to hide the menu by default, so we add **display: none**.

* This is where we import the **dropdown-nav** module (see below). Because we have included it here, we do not need to include it in our main **app.scss** file.

* This ul is the first-level deep sub-menu, and we set a **padding-left** of **2em**.

* The code here controls the **hovered** state of a menu link, and has some basic default styling applied.

* We remove the underline **text-decoration** from the menu links.

* We set the menu links to **display: block**.

* This is where we set the **line-height** of the menu links. By default, this value also controls the height of the header itself.

* We set the color of our menu links to **$grey**. Change this to whatever you want.

* This is where we set the left and right **padding** for the links, to determine how much space there should be between each one.

* We reset the font-size to **1em** (after having set it to 0 on line 13).

* Now that we have entered desktop territory, we align the menu to the right of the page by adding **text-align: right;**.

* We set the **white-space** to **nowrap** to stop our sub-menu links from breaking onto multiple lines.

* We set our list-items to **display: inline-block;** so that they align next to each other now that we are coding for desktops.

* We set the positioning of our list-items to **relative** to contain any children sub-menus.

* After having hidden the menu on line 12 for mobiles, we now reset the display to **block** so it becomes visible by default for desktops.

##### The Dropdown Nav CSS

```css
/* Dropdown Navigation
   Used in: "modules/_main-nav.scss"
================================================================ */

ul {

/******************************************************************
Start building the basic layout for lowest resoluton
******************************************************************/

	@extend ul.reset;
	display: none;
	position: absolute;
	z-index: 999;
	min-width: 185px;
	text-align: left;
	li {
		display: block;
		a {
			background: $dark-grey;
			color: white;
			line-height: 45px;
		}
		&:hover {
			a {
				background: darken($brand-1, 10%);
			}
			> ul {
				display: block;
				a:hover {
					background: darken($brand-1, 20%);
				}
			}
		}
	}
	ul {
		top: 0;
		right: 100%;
	}

/******************************************************************
Start building for larger resolutions
******************************************************************/

	@media (min-width: $breakpoint-4) {
		ul {
			left: 100%;
			right: auto;
		}
	}

} // End dropdown ul

&:hover > ul {
	display: block;
}
```

* We hide the dropdown menu by default by adding **display: none;**.

* We take the dropdown menu out of the normal flow of the website with **position: absolute;** and give it a high **z-index** value so it alays appears above the main content.

* We apply a **min-width** to the dropdown menu so it is never too narrow, and we ensure the text is aligned to the left.

* We tell the list-items to behave as **block** elements.

* We apply our basic styling properties to our menu links.

* We set the **background color** of a **hovered** menu link.

* We tell further nested dropdown menus to display when their parent list item is **hovered**.

* We set the **background color** of further nested dropown menu links.

* This is where we set the positioning of further nested dropdown menus.

* We adjust the positioning of further nested dropdown menus for larger resolutions.

* We tell the first-level dropdown menu to show when the parent menu item is hovered.

### Off-Canvas Navigation

One Nexus comes with an off-canvas mobile menu built using the [Pushy jQuery plugin](http://www.christopheryee.ca/pushy/). We use this by default to convert the main menu into an off-canvas menu for small/mobile displays. The Pushy SCSS partial is located in the **modules** folder, whilst the associated jQuery is located in the **js** folder.:

```html
assets > styles > scss > modules > _off-canvas.nav.scss
```

```html
assets > js > off-canvas-nav.js
```
---

##### The HTML Markup

In order for the off-canvas navigation to function properly, you need to add a few things to your markup. The mobile menu works off of the main menu with the **main-nav** class, so you don't need to create a second menu. The first thing that is required is a container with the **off-canvas-nav** class (the main-nav section will be duplicated within this), and a target jQuery selector by creating a div with an id of **off-canvas-nav** inside the container. The below markup needs to be placed at the bottom of the page, just before the closing **body** tag, making sure it is outside the main **site-content** container.

```html
<nav class="off-canvas-nav">
    <div id="off-canvas-nav"></div>
</nav>
```

Finally, you need an element with the **site-overlay** class - this acts as a mechanism for closing the menu, allowing the user to click anywhere outside the menu to close it. This can be placed anywhere inside the main **site-content** wrapper.

```html
<div class="site-overlay"></div>
```

Finally, you need to create the button that actually opens the menu. This can be achieved by adding the **nav-trigger** class to your element that you wish to act as the open-menu trigger. This element can be placed anywhere inside the main **site-content** wrapper.

```html
<span class="nav-trigger"></span>
```
